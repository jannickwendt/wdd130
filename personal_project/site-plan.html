Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>The goal of my website is to entertain others by showing them pictures of funny animals. Animals are in my opinion one of the most interesting and entertaining topics of our planet and a true blessing for us humans. I want to share that excitement with others.<p>
      <p>In my opinion looking for funny animals can be a bit rough, googling means you get a lot of drawings or edited photos, which is great too of course, but for my sense of humour naturally (no pun intended) funny animals are the best by far. I can limit my own site to these specifically because I will handpick them myself (and with some friends maybe).<p>
      <p>I want to create multiple categories either sorted by the living room of animals, like the sea or tropical forests, or by the type of animal, like fish and birds. These categories may have some categories in them aswell. For an example you can click sea > clownfish. I am also thinking of adding text to a few photos, some may be especially, or even only funny with context.<p>
      <p>The work I will need to do will of course mostly consist of finding, optimizing and adding photos to my html. I will also need to master grid for this type of website (atleast I how I imagine it), which is good because I recently struggled with grid and now I force myself into this position to learn it. I'm also thinking of some "effects". I really liked the zoom-effect we did on the WRR-page. Little details like that really make a website feel interactive and modern.</p>
      <p>Sorry these are not 600 words, but I really don't know what to say. Funny animal pictures, thats it really haha.</p>
